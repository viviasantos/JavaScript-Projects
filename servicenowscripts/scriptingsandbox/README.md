ðŸ§ª ServiceNow Scripts Sandbox
This folder serves as a sandbox for practicing and experimenting with scripts on the ServiceNow platform. It provides a safe environment to explore server-side and client-side scripting, and to learn common patterns used in real-world development.

ðŸŽ¯ Purpose
This is part of my continuous learning journey to understand how to automate and customize processes using JavaScript in ServiceNow. The goal is to simulate practical scenarios often encountered in production environments or technical assessments.

ðŸš§ Constantly evolving â€” new rule examples and tests added regularly!
