ðŸ§ª ServiceNow Scripts Sandbox
This folder is a sandbox for practicing and experimenting scripts on the ServiceNow platform. Itâ€™s a safe testing environment to explore and learn scripting patterns.


ðŸŽ¯ Purpose
This is part of my learning path to understand how to automate and customize using JavaScript in ServiceNow.
It helps simulate real-life scenarios often seen in production environments

ðŸš§ Constantly evolving â€” new rule examples and tests added regularly!
